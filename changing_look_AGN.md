#### Description of changing look (CL) AGN

The conception of changing look AGN is originated from the state transition of X-ray in AGNs. But now, in general situation, it means the emission lines of AGNs changed from type I to type II, or vice versa, changed from type II to type I. The transition from type I to type II is called "turn off", and the reverse case is called "turn on".
